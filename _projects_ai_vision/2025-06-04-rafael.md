Developed a full autonomous UAV simulation pipeline as a trial task for Rafael:

- **C++ Simulator:** Parses flight instructions from text files, simulates UAV kinematics with real physical constraints (constant velocity, minimum turning radius), and outputs time-stamped trajectory data (CSV), including real-time azimuth (heading) calculations.
- **Azimuth Calculation:** Critical for guiding the UAV toward targets and for controlling entry into holding patterns at waypoints.
- **Python Visualization:** Created a `matplotlib` animation that renders the UAV’s flight, showing a dynamic arrow indicating current azimuth—clearly visualizing nose direction and movement logic.
