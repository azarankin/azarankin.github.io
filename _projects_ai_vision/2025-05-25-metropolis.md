Built a real-time smart vision system with **NVIDIA Metropolis** for synchronized multi-camera people tracking:

- **Integrated 4 camera feeds** into a unified DeepStream pipeline
- **Calibrated cameras with homography** for accurate spatial alignment
- **Mapped TrackIDs** to a shared floorplan with real-time visualization
- **Generated synchronized overlays** to display tracked people from all camera angles

This project deepened my expertise in real-time computer vision, multi-camera analytics, and DeepStream pipeline engineering.

> Multi-camera people tracking with live spatial mapping and graphical overlays, using homography calibration and DeepStream inside NVIDIA Metropolis.
